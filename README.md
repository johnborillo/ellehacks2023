# ElleHacks 2023 Project

# Inspiration
Recently, there was an earthquake in Turkey, and we wanted to figure out how others could provide assistance while remaining safe. We wanted to create an online platform to encourage people to learn about these disasters and help out as much as they can.

# What it does
It is a website that can inform users about the major disasters that humanity is currently facing and inspire people to make their own contributions to non-profit organizations. This project will also keep track of how much each donor has already contributed, enhancing their sense of accomplishment.

# How we built it
ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, OpenAI API, ECharts, Canva, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Material UI, Git, VS Code, Figma

# Challenges we ran into
We had a tight deadline to meet because we wanted to include a lot of features on our website. It was incredibly challenging for us to keep our energy and stamina up over the course of the hackathon's three-day duration.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Quickly picked up how to use the OpenAI API while under a lot of time constraints. Quickly picked up how to use eCharts in React. Everyone gave this project their full attention, and we got along pretty well.

# What we learned
The capacity to manage CSS How to establish a back end, connect the front end, and work together as a cross-functional team How to create a schedule or to-do list, plan our time effectively, and meet a deadline How to maintain a work-life balance while having fun

# What's next for Globz
connecting with MongoDB, make it a true MERN full-stack project with a fully responsive design. The authentication page should also be divided into two versions: one for users and one for organizations. Additionally, we intend to improve the user experience and make pages more attractive.
